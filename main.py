  We have not covered this concept yet, but with strings there are built-in functions you can use to make the letters uppercase by using .upper() or lowercase by using .lower()
  There is also a concept called indexing, where we refer to each letter as a number, and we can modify or retrieve a certain letter by using the number it is associated with.
  We enclose the numbers with square brackets [], and note that indexing starts at 0. If you are starting at 0, then you are retrieving the first value in a data type (in this case is a string)
